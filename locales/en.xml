  <translation key="game-of-life">
    <value>
      The Game Of Life is a "cellular automaton" invented by the mathematician John Conway. The concept is very simple: a grid where each square is a cell that can be "alive" or "dead". This "zero player" game follows 2 simple rules: At each iteration, the next state of each cell is defined according to the number of living cells around it. A dead cell "born" if it is surrounded by exactly 3 "alive" cells. A cell remains "alive" if it is surrounded by exactly 2 or 3 cells. These 2 simple rules create an infinite number of possible simulations.
